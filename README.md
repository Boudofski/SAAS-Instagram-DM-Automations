# AP3k

AP3k turns Instagram comments into automated DMs, leads, and sales.

---

## Features

- **Comment → DM automation** — trigger a private DM when a keyword is spotted in a comment
- **3 matching modes** — Exact, Contains, and Smart AI (OpenAI-powered intent matching)
- **Template variables** — `{{username}}`, `{{first_name}}`, `{{keyword}}`, `{{link}}` in every DM
- **Optional public reply** — reply to the comment thread at the same time
- **Lead tracking** — every triggered DM is saved as a lead with full event log
- **Analytics** — per-automation stats: triggers, DMs sent, replies sent, leads captured
- **Stripe billing** — FREE (3 automations) and PRO (unlimited) plans

## Local Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL running locally (or a hosted DB — Neon, Supabase, etc.)
- A [Meta Developer account](https://developers.facebook.com) with an app
- A [Clerk account](https://clerk.com) with an application
- A [Stripe account](https://stripe.com) in test mode
- (Optional) An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com) for Smart AI matching

### 2. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd SAAS-Instagram-DM-Automations
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Copy the example and fill in all values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

See `.env.example` for the full list with inline documentation. Every variable must be set before running `npm run dev`.

### 4. Database

```bash
# Apply migrations and generate the Prisma client
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

To inspect the database locally:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

### 5. Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Meta Developer Setup

### Create a Meta App

1. Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com) → **My Apps** → **Create App**
2. Choose **Business** type
3. Add the **Instagram** product to your app

### Configure OAuth

1. Under **Instagram Login / Business Login**, add an OAuth redirect URI:
   ```
   https://ap3k.com/callback/instagram
   ```
2. Copy the parent Meta **App ID** → `META_APP_ID`
3. Copy the Instagram API setup **Instagram App ID** → `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID`
4. Copy the matching app secret → `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET` if Meta shows a separate Instagram app secret; otherwise `META_APP_SECRET` is used.
4. Request the comment-to-DM permissions used by AP3k:
   - `instagram_business_basic`
   - `instagram_business_manage_comments`
   - `instagram_business_manage_messages`

### Configure the Webhook

You need a public HTTPS URL for Meta to send events. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) in development:

```bash
# Install ngrok, then:
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the `https://xxxx.ngrok.io` URL.

1. Under **Instagram → Webhooks**, add a new subscription:
   - **Callback URL:** `https://ap3k.com/api/webhooks/meta`
   - **Verify Token:** the value you set in `META_VERIFY_TOKEN`
2. Subscribe to `comments` and `messages` fields

Meta will make a GET request to verify the URL — the handler at `/api/webhooks/meta` responds to this automatically.

### Test Accounts

During development, add your personal Instagram account as a **Test User** in the Meta app so it can receive webhooks without going through App Review.

## Stripe Setup

### Test Mode Keys

1. Go to [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com) → **Developers → API Keys**
2. Copy the **Secret key** (`sk_test_...`) → `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
3. Copy the **Publishable key** (`pk_test_...`) → `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### Create Prices

1. Go to **Products → Add Product** → create `AP3k Creator` as a recurring monthly product
2. Copy the Creator **Price ID** (`price_...`) → `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_CREATOR`
3. Create `AP3k Agency` as a recurring monthly product
4. Copy the Agency **Price ID** (`price_...`) → `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_AGENCY`

### Stripe Webhook (Local)

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI, then:
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

Copy the **webhook signing secret** it prints → `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

Events handled:
- `checkout.session.completed` — upgrades user to PRO
- `customer.subscription.created` — syncs a new subscription if it arrives before/after checkout completion
- `customer.subscription.updated` — syncs plan status
- `customer.subscription.deleted` — downgrades to FREE

---

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test           # run once
npm run test:watch # watch mode
```

---

## Vercel Deployment

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 2. Import in Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) → import repository
2. Framework: **Next.js** (auto-detected)

### 3. Set Environment Variables

In Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables, add every variable from `.env.example` with production values. Key differences from local:

| Variable | Production value |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST_URL` | `https://ap3k.com` |
| `META_APP_ID` | Meta app ID |
| `META_APP_SECRET` | Meta app secret |
| `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID` | Instagram app ID from Instagram API setup; used as OAuth `client_id` |
| `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET` | Optional Instagram app secret if different from Meta app secret |
| `META_VERIFY_TOKEN` | Same value entered in Meta webhook config |
| `META_REDIRECT_URI` | `https://ap3k.com/callback/instagram` |
| `INSTAGRAM_EMBEDDED_OAUTH_URL` | Full Instagram OAuth URL with `redirect_uri=https://ap3k.com/callback/instagram` |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Live or test secret key from Stripe |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Matching live or test publishable key from Stripe |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_CREATOR` | Creator recurring price ID |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_AGENCY` | Agency recurring price ID |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Secret from Vercel webhook endpoint (see below) |

### 4. Stripe Webhook (Production)

1. Go to Stripe → **Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint**
2. URL: `https://ap3k.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
4. Copy the signing secret → `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel env vars

### 5. Meta Webhook (Production)

Update the webhook callback URL in Meta Developer Console:

```text
https://ap3k.com/api/webhooks/meta
```

Use the same verify token value that is stored in `META_VERIFY_TOKEN`.

Subscribe the Instagram webhook to:
- `comments`
- `messages`

Webhook POST requests are verified with Meta's `x-hub-signature-256` header
using `META_APP_SECRET`. Comment and messaging receipts are stored in
`WebhookEvent`, matched campaign activity is stored in `AutomationEvent`, and
send attempts are stored in `MessageLog`.

AP3k only sends a private reply/DM to users who commented or messaged the connected Instagram account. It does not scrape Instagram, log in with passwords, or send unsolicited DMs.

### Why real comments may not trigger in Meta development mode

Meta dashboard test webhooks only prove the callback URL and verify token work.
They do not prove that a real Instagram comment is eligible for delivery.

For real comment delivery while the app is still in Development mode, verify:

- The connected Instagram account is Business or Creator.
- The connected account owns the media being commented on.
- The commenter is a separate Instagram account, not the connected business account.
- The commenter has been added as a Meta app admin/developer/tester and accepted the invite.
- The app is subscribed to `comments,messages` for the connected IG user after OAuth.
- Vercel production has `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID`, `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET`, `META_APP_ID`, `META_APP_SECRET`, `META_VERIFY_TOKEN`, `META_REDIRECT_URI`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST_URL`.

The dashboard Integrations page includes **Resubscribe webhooks** and webhook
health cards. Do not mark delivery fixed until a real comment creates
`WebhookEvent.eventType = COMMENT_WEBHOOK_RECEIVED`.

### Owner Admin

AP3k includes a safe owner-only admin UI at:

```text
/admin
```

Access is server-side restricted to:

```text
ADMIN_EMAILS=officialabde@gmail.com
ADMIN_CLERK_USER_IDS=<optional comma-separated Clerk user IDs>
```

The admin panel shows production counts, users, integrations, campaigns,
webhook events, automation events, message logs, and leads. It masks tokens and
does not expose Prisma Studio or raw secrets publicly.

## Known Limitations

- **Plan enforcement** — FREE plan limit (3 automations) is tracked in the DB schema but not yet enforced on the backend. Activation is not blocked for FREE users. Marked as TODO.
- **Story reply automations** — the DB schema supports story reply triggers but the wizard UI does not expose them.
- **Token refresh** — Instagram long-lived tokens expire after 60 days. AP3k refreshes near expiry when the user profile is loaded, but users may need to reconnect if Meta revokes a token or permissions change.
- **Smart AI matching** — requires a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`. If missing or the call fails, the automation silently skips the DM.
